# DoctorCalendarManagementSystem

## Enviroment Setup
 - Java SDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
 - Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
 - PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

## To Run the Project
1. Make sure you have all the environments properly setup. 
2. The Database migration would run automatically when the program is running for the first time, meaning initial database and data would be setup automatically.
3. Open an IDE and click on the green icon (so that you don't have to manually mvn compile, package and execute the java code from an executable JAR file)
